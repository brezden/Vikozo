# Vikozo

> Build stronger financial habits

## Project Description

Vikozo is a free personal budgeting app that will be able to help
people manage their money and simulate investments to practice
investment skills. Users will be able to see real time stock prices and
add them to their simulated portfolio to see how they would perform if they had
invested in them. Alongside this, users will be able to setup budgets and get
stats on monthly expenses and other information to better understand how their money
is being spent.

## Project Information

Vikozo is currently being built with React, Tailwind CSS, Django and MySQL.
